                      you to have access to a desktop or laptop computer and reliable internet connection for certain
                      course components. Former students have told us it is easiest to read discussion threads and

                    Get your certificate: When you successfully complete an Online Course, you are eligible to receive a
                    digital certificate of completion. We encourage you to review your instructor’s syllabus to understand
                    the Certificate of Completion requirements for your course. These requirements often include the following:
                    Active participation in the majority of discussion boards
                    Timely submission of all assignments.
                    Certificates of Completion are delivered to the email used at the time of registration, and can be expected
                    no later than 3 weeks after the course ends. These digital verified credentials allow you to present a
                    trustworthy record of your learning to anyone at any time.
                    Our certificate platform, Accredible, permits you to share your achievement on various social media platforms,
                    embed it on your website, and add it to your LinkedIn profile.</p>

                        <ul>
                          <li>Online resources and materials stored in digital classes are at the fingertips of the users.</li>
                          <li>Online discussions promote collaborative exploration and critical thinking and hence foster deeper
                            understanding among students towards the subject matter.</li>
                          <li>Students build their skills of becoming independent and responsible by logging in to view and
                            submit assignments and hence monitor progress. This is something they would normally experience
                            in college and in their career.</li>
                          <li>Jingo Institute promotes student confidence. Some of the teachers on Easyclass say that one
                              student who isn’t comfortable speaking up in the classroom is opening up online.</li>
